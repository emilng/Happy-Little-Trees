Generative Art Tool

computer based drawing tool that can turn what you draw into a pattern and allow you to draw with those patterns

example:
draw a shape, take it and repeat it 6 times in a circle to create a snowflake pattern
you can automatically transform the original shape to make a limitless number of unique snowflake patterns all from one shape
which is faster than drawing by hand and may create snowflakes you never would have imagined
